## Introduction

This project focuses on an image classification task where the goal is to classify RGB images into one of 100 object categories. The input consists of natural scene images, and the challenge is to design an efficient deep learning model based on the ResNet architecture that can accurately predict the correct category for each image. The task emphasizes optimizing classification accuracy while adhering to model size constraints, encouraging thoughtful model design and experimentation within a limited architectural scope.
